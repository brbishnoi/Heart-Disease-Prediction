# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Heart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, with over 17.9
million deaths reported each year. Early detection and timely interventions can greatly
reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with heart disease. Current approaches
to heart disease prediction rely on subjective evaluation and may not be accurate or
efficient enough to identify at-risk patients early. Therefore, there is a need for a more
accurate and efficient approach to heart disease prediction.

I've used a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features as a variety of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.

Machine Learning algorithms used:

1.Logistic Regression 

2.Naive Bayes

3.KNN

4.Random Forest

# Result
We can see that all four models (logistic regression, Naive Bayes, KNN, and Random
Forest) achieved high accuracy scores ranging from 0.87% to 0.92%. Looking at the
precision, recall, and F1-score values, we can see that all models performed well in
terms of identifying patients with heart disease (label 1), with precision, recall, and
F1-score values ranging from 0.85 to 0.91. Overall, the Random Forest model had the
highest accuracy 91.8% and F1-score values, indicating that it may be the best model for this
classification task.
